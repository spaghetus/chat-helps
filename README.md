# Chat Helps

make live programming 500% more chaotic by allowing twitch chat into your text editor

this extension allows your chat to add meaningless error squiggles to your editor by typing a message like the following

* `help ./src/lib.rs 69 ðŸ¦€ your productivity is gone ðŸ¦€`
* `help ./public/index.html 12 Expected ;, found <.`
* `help ./README.md 1 bepis`

error squiggles last for thirty seconds, i might add a setting to change that in the future
